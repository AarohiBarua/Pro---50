            Step1:Start with a square piece of paper.Fold the paper in half by taking
            the top corner and folding it to the bottom corner. The crease should run 
            from the left corner tip to the right corner tip. <br> <br>
            Step2:Fold the triangle in half by taking the right corner and folding it to
            the left. <br> <br>
            Step3:Take the top flap and open it, creasing the left and right sides so 
            you can fold the top/right cornerto the bottom corner. <br> <br>
            Step4:Now we'll turn the paper over and do the same thing to the other side.<br> <br>
            Step5:Turn over. Lift the right flap so it stands vertically.Grab the left
            and right side of the flap and open it up.Crease the sides so you can fold the
            top corner down to the bottom. <br> <br>
            Step7:Open the flap upwards.Fold the left and right sides inward.Turn the 
            paper upward. <br> <br>
            Step8:Repeat steps 7-9 on this side. <br> <br>
            Step9:Fold both sides of the upper layer and fold the lower parts into the 
            center.Do the same thing on the other side. <br> <br>
            Step10:Inside reverse.Fold up both sides of the paper.<br> <br>
            Step11:Make a inside reverse fold on the back part to make the camel's legs.
            Fold the top flap down and repeat on the other side. <br> <br>
            Step12: Make a inside reverse fold on the left-top tip down to make the head
            and make a inside reverse on the tip of the head.<br> <br>
            Step13:Fold the back of the leg inside and repeat on the other side.<br> <br>
            Step14:Draw the eyes and your camel is finished.
